Universal File Converter
Welcome to Universal File Converter—your ultimate, all-in-one desktop hub for file management, media playback, and downloading. Why use five different programs when you can do everything seamlessly in one lightweight app?

✨ Features
🔀 Universal Converter: Easily convert almost any file type. Whether you are working with audio tracks, video files, high-res images, or documents, this app handles it all.

📂 Auto-Organizer: Say goodbye to messy download folders. The app can automatically scan and organize your directories by sorting files into neat folders based on their formats.

📥 Universal Downloader: Grab videos and files from almost any website on the internet.

Note: If a website is geo-blocked or restricted in your region, simply enable your VPN before downloading, and the app will handle the rest.

▶️ Built-In Media Player: No need to export your files just to view them. Watch your downloaded videos and listen to your music library directly inside the app's native media player.

⚠️ Important Usage Note
To get the most out of this app, you must enable "Minimize to Tray" in the settings.

Enabling this feature allows the app to stay active in the background when you close the main window. This is required if you want to:

Keep listening to your music while gaming or multitasking.

Allow the auto-organizer to sort your folders silently in the background.

🚀 Roadmap & Contributing
I am passionately working on this app to make it faster, smoother, and packed with even more features. Updates are rolling out frequently!

If you encounter any bugs or have feature requests, please open an issue or reach out.
